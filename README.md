🚀 My First Database System Project! 🚀

Excited to share my first project, where I built a Company Database System using both Code First and Database First approaches in .NET and SQL Server! 💻📊

🔍 Project Overview:
A big company needs a structured way to manage employees, departments, and projects. This system helps store and organize data efficiently while maintaining relationships between entities.

📌 Key Features:
✅ Employees Management: Track employees’ details, supervisors, and dependents.
✅ Department Structure: Each department has a unique number, name, locations, and a manager.
✅ Projects Management: Employees work on multiple projects, tracking working hours.
✅ Entity Relationships:
🔹 Each employee belongs to one department but can work on multiple projects.
🔹 Each project is assigned to one department but has several employees working on it.
🔹 Every employee has a supervisor and can have dependents.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
🛠 .NET Core, Entity Framework (Code First & Database First), SQL Server

🎯 What I Learned:
🔹 How to design an ERD diagram for a relational database
🔹 Implementing one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
🔹 Differences between Code First and Database First approaches
🔹 Writing optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval

💡 This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my database design and ASP.NET Core skills! Looking forward to working on more complex systems.
